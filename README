## WordPress-Posts-React

A lightweight set of React hooks and components to asynchronously fetch and display WordPress posts using WordPress's most updated [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). 

### Why? 
Almost all of the other WordPress React libraries I found were either too bloated or too old and unmaintained, which uses outdated mechanisms to retrieve blog articles off WordPress sites. This library is designed to be as lightweight as possible (no dependencies), and provides drop-in components to display posts in a variety of ways directly in your React app.



### Development 
This package uses Rollup to bundle the library. To build it, run with either:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To do this in watch mode, run:
```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```
